To start off the project we wrote all of the grammar rules in the GLSL specifications that were highlighted into parser.y. 
Many of these rules were redundant or could be simplified. 
After completing the grammar and making sure that it could compile we gradually started adding actions to the production rules. 
We would test after adding each rule. 
We had trouble with arrays and function calls in general.
Ultimately, we tried to simplify as many of the rules as possible before creating actions. We also read through each of the .h files
and Piazza (extensively) in order to determine which types we should classify various objects in the actions for each rules.
We tested primarily using gdb and print statements.
