When approaching this project, we started by implementing the symbol table.
We added an enum which keeps track of all the possible types of Scopes we can encounter,
a symbol table which is a stack (implemented using a vector) of maps keeping identifiers and declarations,
and another stack (implemented using a vector) which keeps track of the Types of the Scopes we encounter using the enum described above.
We also implemented methods for our symbol table to push and pop scopes, add declarations, and search for declarations/identifiers
When semantically analyzing the given code, we would call check methods on objects encountered to make sure declarations were added to
the symbol table, and to assign types. Often, when encountering an incorrect type, we would convert this object to an errorType to avoid
unnecessary error cascading.
To test and debug our code, we used various testing files, print statements/methods, and gdb.
